## Description of block diagram
* When you press a button on your key fob, you’re waking up its Central Processing Unit (CPU) inside.
* The CPU sends a data stream to the radio frequency (RF) transmitter. The keyless remote is actually a radio.
* This data stream contains command and for security, rolling codes.
* The remote keyless system’s receiver in the car captures the RF signal, extracts it and sends the data stream to the CPU.
* The CPU decodes it and sends commands to the command module.
* The toggling of LEDs happen according to the command
* The car sends the signal as well and displays the window, alarm and door status and car batter info
